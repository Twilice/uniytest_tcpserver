todo :: write todo list


Now base functionality is working. We can start to add back / figure out why the connection was dropped.

Maybe it was not a total threading issue, only the other issues that stopped it from working as expected.

Next steps should probably be to:

 * figure out how to continuously listen on messages from the client. But without permanently listening to read request. 
	- We want to be able to have 50k clients, but not listen to 50k clients at the same time.

 * figure out if it is possible to send (write) message and listen to listen (read) in different threads without issues

 * reconnect functionality if needed


Later steps

 * more service like for game

 * implement in Unity
	- check for restrictions, (easy stuff to test that catches lots of issues, standalone - mono,  standalone - il2cpp, webgl - il2cpp)

 * host somewhere to test real life case


Later Later Later steps

 * make multiple services - game / chat / etc.

 * make an actual game
